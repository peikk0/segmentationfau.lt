Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a Linux/Unix system administrator and DevOps engineer in
Lyon, France. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy longboarding, urban and
events photography, drumming, playing the guitar and eating bacon.

I'm moving to New Zealand next august, as I fell in love with this amazing
country on a trip some months ago. As a result, I'm open to any job offers in
Wellington, New Zealand. You can read [my CV](/cv/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}
or [my LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/pierreguinoiseau/){:target="_blank"},
and you can contact me via email at *pierre(at)guinoiseau(dot)eu*. ;-)
