Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a Linux/FreeBSD system administrator and DevOps in Lyon,
France. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy longboarding, urban and events
photography, drumming, playing the guitar and eating bacon.

My project in the near future is to move to New Zealand, as I fell in love with
this amazing country on a trip some months ago. As a result, I'm open to any
job offers in New Zealand, preferably near Wellington. You can read [my
resume on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/pierreguinoiseau/), and/or you can
contact me via email at *pierre(at)guinoiseau(dot)eu* to ask my CV in PDF
format and any other informations. ;-)
