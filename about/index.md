Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a french Linux/Unix system administrator and DevOps
engineer in Wellington, New Zealand, currently employed as a DevOps engineer at
[Catalyst](http://www.catalyst.net.nz/). I'm also a FreeBSD enthusiast and a
Ruby aficionado. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy longboarding, urban and
events photography, drumming, playing the guitar and eating bacon.
