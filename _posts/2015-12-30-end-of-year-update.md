A few weeks turned out to be a few months and I've delayed this update post
long enough so here it is, only 2 days before 2016!

I've been in New Zealand for almost 5 months now, I'm living in a shared
house in Kelburn -- a beautiful suburb of Wellington, I'm working as a
DevOps engineer in the eLearning team at
[Catalyst](https://www.catalyst.net.nz/), and so far it has been really great!
Oh and by the way, [we are hiring!](https://www.catalyst.net.nz/jobs)

Obtaining a work visa took way longer than expected, let me explain. I've
decided to apply for a *Work to Residence Visa*, this is a temporary work visa
that allows you to apply for a resident visa later on after 2 years living in
the country. Reading the [requirements on the immigration
website](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/worktemporarily/requirements/),
I thought I would only need to provide a copy of my employment agreement. I was
*so* wrong. After reading the actual application forms I would actually have to
provide:

 - a **police certificate** from France, translated in English -- it only takes
   10 days to receive it by mail, meaning it was sent at most 2 days after the
   request (props to the French Ministry of Justice for being fast for once);
 - a **general medical examination** (because I'm staying for more than 6
   months), complete with a **chest X-Ray** (because I'm staying for more than
   12 months) -- I got the results in a few days but it's very expensive here,
   I would have done it in France if I knew better before my departure;
 - ***certified* copies of all my diplomas and work certificates**, all
   translated in English -- I only had plain photocopies of those, so I had to
   ask my awesome parents (thank you so much!) to make certified copies and
   send them to me, but it tooks **3 weeks** for the mail to get here! After
   that, the translation (along with the police certificate) took 5 more days
   and it was freaking expensive too!;
 - my **employment agreement**, obviously;
 - **passport pictures**, obvious too.

So I spent the whole month of August gathering those documents, until I could
apply for the work visa on the second week of September. And then it was the
waiting gameâ€¦ This was only supposed to take 10 working days to be processed,
but it turned out to be way longer than that... On the application form I had
to declare that I got a (minor) driving offence while I was in holidays here 2
years ago, a tiny speed offence by 5km/h. You had better be honest with that,
lying or "forgetting" about it could deny you any further visa, or at least
make things a lot more difficult. Little did I know that it would add **40
days** to the processing delay! That's because they had to ask a police
certificate from the New Zealand Police, who needs at least **30 days** to
search and print an empty record! And then the immigration officer was either
on leave or busy on other tasks. I finally got my work visa by the end of
October, **a week** before expiration of my 3 months visitor visa -- *phew*.
This visa is valid for almost 2,5 years, until April of 2018, which is perfect.
I started working the day I got it, relieved to finally start making money to
fill up my now dry bank account (my savings were not meant to finance a 3
months wait for a visa, I must say bye-bye to my holidays for this summer).

Now the next things to do, my mind at peace, are:

 - applying for a Skilled Migrant Visa, to get a resident visa even sooner,
   which will be very useful to get access to healthcare, national insurance,
   and save for retirement -- I'm 99.99% sure to obtain it, it will take 8 to
   12 months but I'm in no hurry this time;
 - bring my stuffs back from France;
 - save some money to go abroad on holidays next July/August, maybe to Canada;
 - **enjoy my new life in New Zealand!**

Next update in a few months I guess!
