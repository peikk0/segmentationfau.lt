Long time, no update. So here are some news!

In March I passed the IELTS with a band score of 7, high enough for a NZ skilled migrant visa! However I'll get a temporary work visa first, because it's easier and faster (~25 days) to get, whereas obtaining a skilled migrant visa can take up to a year.

I have booked a room in a backpacker for the first 2 weeks, to let me some time to find a nice home.

I have got a job offer in a really nice company! So I'll be able to start working as soon as I get my work visa, which should be in September.

Today is my last day working at M6Web, it has been really great to work here during those 4.5 years, and I wish a lot of success to my colleagues!

Finally, I'm leaving France next Tuesday, and I will arrive in New Zealand next Thursday, after a long 31h trip...!

Next update in a few weeks when I'm settled. :)
