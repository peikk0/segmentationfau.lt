First news about my project to move to New Zealand!

Last month I bought my one-way flight tickets to Wellington, so I'm officially
leaving on 4th August 2015! It wasn't cheap but I picked (almost) the right
moment to buy it at the best price possible, for once. Next step is to find a
job and apply for a visa.

I just updated my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} and my
[LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/pierreguinoiseau){:target="_blank"},
so I'm now ready to spam everyone with it. ;-) I'm hoping to join a company
with a great culture, a love for open source technologies, and interesting
challenges!

As for the visa, I need to pass the IELTS first, which I will next month,
hopefully it should be fine, but it's still a bit stressful. Then I'll apply
for the Skilled Migrant Visa, which should be fine and fast if I manage to get
a job offer before.

Wish me luck!
