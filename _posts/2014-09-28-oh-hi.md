So, after years of reluctance, I finally set up my personal blog. Great. Now I
guess I'll have to write some posts... Yeah you can feel my enthusiasm, right?
Anyways, I wanted to have a homepage somewhere, to gain some visibility on the
great interwebz and have something to put in the 'homepage' section on social
medias, so here it is.

Still, I may write some posts from time to time, I actually already have some
subjects in mind, that I have been holding for quite some time really, now I
just need some time and motivation. I might talk about sysadmin/devops
subjects, photography, music... and I will also give updates on my project to
move from France to New Zealand, and maybe give some advices for those who wish
to do the same. In fact, that may be the main subject.

Speaking of which, I'm looking for a job in New Zealand, preferably near
Wellington, starting mid-2015, so any offers or pointers are very welcome!

And if you wish to know more about me, check out the 'About me' section, and
the social media links in the bio.

Stay in touch!
