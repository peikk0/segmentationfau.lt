Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a Frenchman and now Kiwi, living in Wellington, New
Zealand since August 2015. Professionally I've been a software developer, a
sysadmin, a DevOps engineer and I'm now a Site Reliability Engineer at
[Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/)! I'm also a FreeBSD enthusiast and a
Ruby aficionado. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy practicing martial arts
(Wing Tsun, Muay Thai), trekking, longboarding, playing the guitar, and many
other things!
