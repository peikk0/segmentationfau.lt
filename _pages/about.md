Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a Frenchman and now Kiwi, living in Wellington, New
Zealand since August 2015. Professionally I've been a software developer, a
sysadmin, a DevOps engineer and I will be a SRE in my next adventure very soon!
I'm a FreeBSD enthusiast and a Ruby aficionado. When I'm not on my computer, I
enjoy practicing martial arts (Wing Tsun, Muay Thai), trekking, longboarding,
playing the guitar, and many other things!
