Hi! I'm Pierre, I'm a Frenchman turned Kiwi, living in Wellington, New
Zealand since August 2015, currently employed as a DevOps engineer at
[Catalyst](http://www.catalyst.net.nz/). I'm also a FreeBSD enthusiast and a
Ruby aficionado. When I'm not on my computer, I enjoy drinking beer, trekking,
longboarding, urban and events photography, drumming, playing the guitar, and
many other things!
